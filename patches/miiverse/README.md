# Miiverse patches
Based on the original patches by [Stary](https://github.com/Stary2001) and [Sono](https://github.com/SonoSooS),
but cleaned up a bit with a Makefile closer to the rest of the Nimbus patches.

Any region decompressed Miiverse code.bin should work for building.

To compile, you need armips, make, flips, and the aforementioned Miiverse `code.bin`.
